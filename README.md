# RC_Flying_Wing_Model
A small (~800mm) flying wing made from foam, plywood and composites. This model is designed to fit the parts I had - especially the battery - so it might not work with other ones. Here is What I used: Lion 4000mha 30A 4s battery made out of 21700 cells and Caddax Tarsier v2. Rest of the parts should be pretty standard.
I will upload a build manual on a later date.
